# lisp-interperter-finished-after-reading-SICP
The first interpreter 
I want to finish this little interpreter according to <Structrue and Interpretation of Computer Program> and <How to finish a interpreter> written by Yin Wang,which will be the basic component of a simple compiler.
The whole process can be divided into several steps as follows:
  1.A simple calculator written in python or C++;
  2.A interpreter for lisp written in python ;
  3.A interpreter for lisp written in C++;
